## Acknowledgements

What an awesome project this was to make. I spent a few days on it, refactoring code and shuffling things around as needed. My code got a bit messy towards the end, and I would love to clean it up once I have some more experience. 

Thanks to the team at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for pointers on this project and their awesome course.

Thank you to these users at freesound.org for supplying some great UI sounds:
